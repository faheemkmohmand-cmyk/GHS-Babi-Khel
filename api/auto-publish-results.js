// api/auto-publish-results.js
// Vercel Cron Job target — runs server-side on a schedule (see vercel.json
// "crons") and does NOT depend on any admin/user having a browser tab open.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
//   The "Schedule Publish" feature in AdminResults.tsx sets `publish_at` on
//   `results` rows, but the ONLY code that ever checked whether that time had
//   passed was `ResultCountdownTimer`, a React component that runs its check
//   inside a `useEffect` in the admin's own browser. If the admin (or anyone)
//   didn't have that exact panel open in a tab when the countdown hit zero,
//   `is_published` never flipped to `true` — so the Home page kept showing
//   the BISE Peshawar fallback forever, even though the countdown said 0s.
//
//   This endpoint fixes that by doing the actual publish flip on the server,
//   on a schedule, independent of any browser being open.
//
// CRITICAL BUG FIX (auto-republish loop):
//   The previous version of this endpoint only flipped `is_published` to
//   true and NEVER cleared `publish_at`. That meant:
//     1. Admin schedules a publish with publish_at = X
//     2. Timer fires / this cron runs → is_published = true (good)
//     3. Admin later clicks "Unpublish Results" → is_published = false
//        BUT publish_at = X is STILL SET (and X is now in the past)
//     4. This cron runs again next minute → sees publish_at <= now AND
//        is_published = false → RE-PUBLISHES the rows admin just unpublished
//     5. Infinite loop: admin can never unpublish results that ever had
//        a schedule set on them
//
//   The fix: in the SAME PATCH that flips is_published=true, also set
//   `publish_at = null`. This "consumes" the schedule — once published, the
//   row no longer has a publish_at, so the cron will never touch it again
//   even if admin later unpublishes it manually.
//
// SECURITY:
//   Protected by CRON_SECRET so randoms can't hit this URL and mass-publish
//   results early. Vercel automatically sends this header for Cron-triggered
//   invocations when CRON_SECRET is set as an env var (see vercel.json).
//
// SETUP REQUIRED (one-time):
//   1. In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables, add:
//        CRON_SECRET = <any long random string>
//   2. vercel.json now has a "crons" entry hitting this route every minute.
//   3. Redeploy.

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // ── Auth ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Two ways this endpoint is called:
  //   1. Vercel Cron (scheduled, server-to-server) — sends `Authorization:
  //      Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`.
  //   2. Any visitor's browser, the instant their local countdown hits zero
  //      (see useAutoPublishTrigger() in Home.tsx / Results.tsx). This call
  //      has NO secret attached.
  //
  // We allow #2 without a secret because this endpoint is narrowly safe to
  // expose publicly: it can ONLY flip `is_published=true` on rows whose
  // `publish_at` has ALREADY passed (see the `publish_at=lte.<now>` filter
  // below). Nobody can use it to publish early, alter marks, or do anything
  // except "reveal a result that was already due to be revealed" — which is
  // exactly what would happen anyway once the cron next ticks. Calling it
  // early or repeatedly is a harmless no-op (0 rows match once already
  // published, since publish_at is cleared in the same update).
  //
  // If a secret IS configured and IS sent, it must match — this keeps the
  // Vercel Cron call authenticated as before. A request with no secret at
  // all is allowed through as the safe public trigger case.
