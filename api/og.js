It is the government education board responsible for conducting, regulating and certifying Secondary School Certificate (SSC, Class 9 and 10) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC, Class 11 and 12) examinations in Peshawar District and several adjacent districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan." },
    { q: "How do I apply for rechecking or re-totaling of my BISE Peshawar result?", a: "If you believe your BISE Peshawar result marks are incorrect, you can apply for rechecking (also called re-totaling) within 15 days of result declaration. Visit the BISEP office at Jamrud Road, Peshawar, or apply through your school. The rechecking fee is paid via bank challan at designated banks. Only the totals are re-counted — the answer sheet is not re-evaluated. Updated marks (if any) are reflected in a revised result card." },
    { q: "How do I apply for result correction (name, father name, date of birth) in BISE Peshawar?", a: "To correct a name, father name or date of birth error on your BISE Peshawar result card, submit a result correction application through your school along with the original B-Form from NADRA, your father's CNIC copy and the original result card. The board processes corrections through its Record department. Processing typically takes 4 to 8 weeks. Always verify your B-Form details before enrollment to prevent such errors." },
