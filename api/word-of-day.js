// api/word-of-day.js
// Vercel Serverless Function — returns the English Word of the Day
// (word + phonetic + definition + example) for the homepage.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS WAS REWRITTEN (2026-08-31) — the "Could not load today's word" bug
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The previous version fetched the daily word LIVE from third-party APIs
// (api.dictionaryapi.dev, api.datamuse.com, api.wordnik.com). On the deployed
// site this broke permanently. Verified against production on 2026-08-31:
//
//   GET https://ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/api/word-of-day  →  HTTP 502
//   {"ok":false,"detail":["Dictionary timed out after 8000ms",
//                         "No Datamuse candidate resolved"]}
//
// i.e. the serverless function itself was healthy, but its OUTBOUND calls to
// the dictionary APIs timed out from the deployment region, so every visitor
// saw "Could not load today's word. Please check your connection." Calling
// those APIs from the browser is not an alternative either — the site's CSP
// `connect-src` whitelist (vercel.json) only allows 'self' + approved
// domains, so dictionary/datamuse requests from the page are silently blocked.
//
// THE FIX — zero external dependency for the daily word:
//   The word of the day is now served from a hand-curated dictionary dataset
//   embedded below (word, IPA phonetics, part of speech, definition, example
//   sentence, synonyms for every entry). The handler is fully deterministic:
//     • a seeded PRNG picks one entry per PKT calendar date,
//     • every visitor sees the same word all day,
//     • the word changes automatically at midnight (Asia/Karachi),
//     • the response is generated in ~0 ms with NO network calls, so it can
//       never time out again.
//   The dataset is written by hand from standard dictionary definitions —
//   no upstream API is consulted for the daily word at all.
//
// The `?word=…` sub-route (double-click-any-word popup) still performs a
// best-effort LIVE lookup via the Free Dictionary API, because the popup can
// ask for arbitrary words that cannot be pre-embedded. It degrades gracefully
// (HTTP 404 → "No definition found") when the upstream is unreachable.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Response shape (identical to before — the React component needs NO changes):
//   {
//     ok: true,
//     word: "serendipity",
//     phonetics: [{ text: "/ˌsɛr.ənˈdɪp.ɪ.ti/", audio: "" }],
//     meanings: [
//       { partOfSpeech: "noun",
//         definitions: [{ definition: "…", example: "…", synonyms: ["…"] }] }
//     ],
//     source: "curated-offline",
//     date: "2026-08-31"
//   }
