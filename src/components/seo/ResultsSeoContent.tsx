// VISIBLE ON-PAGE SEO CONTENT for the /results route.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ───────────────
// The /results page already has strong technical SEO (Helmet meta, JSON-LD,
// canonical, hreflang, sitemap, OG/Twitter cards) and a working result-search
// UI. But Google ranks PAGES, not just meta tags — to outrank BISE Peshawar's
// official result page (cloud.bisep.edu.pk) for generic queries like
// "BISE Peshawar Result", "SSC Result", "BISEP Result", "Peshawar Board
// Result", the page itself must contain genuine, useful, keyword-relevant
// BODY CONTENT that matches user search intent.
//
// This component adds exactly that, as a single self-contained section that
// renders BELOW the existing result-search box (so the existing UX is
// untouched). It is purely additive:
//
//   • Does NOT modify the search box, BISEP proxy, or any existing logic.
//   • Does NOT change the page URL, route, or breadcrumbs.
//   • Uses semantic HTML (section > h2 > h3, p, ul, dl) so Googlebot can
//     parse it cleanly.
//   • Every paragraph is real, human-readable content — no keyword stuffing,
//     no hidden text. Google penalises both, and rightly so.
//   • Internal links to /result-card, /admission, /notes, /calendar help
//     Google understand the site's content graph and pass PageRank to the
//     result-related pages.
//
// The matching structured data (FAQPage, HowTo, ItemList, Service schemas)
// lives in RouteSEOInjector.tsx so it is injected via Helmet at the document
// <head> level. Keep the two files in sync when editing Q&A wording.
