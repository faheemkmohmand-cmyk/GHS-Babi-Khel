 * Site-wide JSON-LD schemas: Organization, HighSchool (with full address),
 * WebSite (with SearchAction). Mounted once at app root.
 *
 * ── Problem 4 fix ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Phone, email, address and principal name are now pulled LIVE from the
 * school_settings table (the same values the admin edits in the dashboard),
 * instead of being hardcoded here. Before, Google read a stale phone and a
 * non-existent email (ghsbabikhel@edu.pk) from this schema even after the
 * admin updated the website — because this file never changed.
 *
 * The fallbacks below are only used if the settings fetch fails, and now
 * match the REAL school details (ghsbabikhel@gmail.com).
 *
 * `sameAs` now lists the school's official Facebook page (from Contact.tsx)
 * so Google connects the website + Facebook page into one entity — this is
 * what lets the website outrank the Facebook page for the school's name.
