// src/data/faqData.mjs — CANONICAL FAQ dataset (single source of truth)
//
// ONE file, FIVE consumers — they can never drift apart:
//   1. src/pages/FAQ.tsx            → the public /faq page (humans)
//   2. src/components/seo/RouteSEOInjector.tsx → FAQPage JSON-LD on app pages
//   3. api/render.js                → live crawler HTML for /faq (AI/search bots)
//                                     + "faq" section of the machine-readable feed
//   4. scripts/seo-page-content.mjs → build-time fallback page for /faq
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN src/data (and NOT in api/):
//   The frontend build (Vite) must NEVER depend on any file inside api/ —
//   api/ is deployed as Vercel Serverless Functions and its files get added,
//   merged and deleted as the function budget changes (Hobby plan caps at 12).
//   A missing api/ file once broke the whole production build. Data that the
//   React app needs belongs inside src/. Serverless functions CAN safely
//   import from src/ — Vercel bundles the imported files with the function.
//
// IMPORTANT CONTENT RULES
//   • Every answer must state ONLY verified facts about the school
//     (same facts as api/seo.js "llms" kind). No invented dates, names or fees.
//   • LIVE values (is admission open right now? session year? deadlines?)
//     are deliberately NOT hardcoded here — they come from the
//     admission_settings / school_settings tables at request time
//     (the data layer inlined in api/render.js). This file covers timeless
//     procedure.
//   • Keep answers self-contained: AI tools often read a single Q&A
//     without the surrounding page.

    question: "Are admissions open at GHS Babi Khel right now?",
    answer:
      "Admissions at Government High School Babi Khel are open every academic session for classes 6 to 10, and admission is completely free of charge as in all government schools of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The current open/closed status, session year and any deadlines are shown live at the top of the Admission page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/admission) and are also published in the machine-readable feed at ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/api/ai-data. If the online form is temporarily paused, you can still download the printable admission form from the same page and submit it at the school office.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-classes",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "Which classes can I apply for admission to?",
    answer:
      "You can apply for admission to classes 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The school is a high school affiliated with BISE Peshawar, so classes 9 and 10 prepare students for the board's SSC examinations as regular candidates. Boys and girls from Babi Khel and the surrounding areas of District Mohmand are both eligible, including students migrating from other schools.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-how",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "How do I apply for admission online, step by step?",
    answer:
      "Step 1: open the Admission page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/admission) and fill the online eligibility application — student name, father name, date of birth, B-Form number, contact number, the class you are applying for, and previous-school details. Step 2: upload the required documents when prompted. Step 3: submit the form — the website immediately issues a reference number. Step 4: the school reviews your application and documents. Step 5: if approved, download the printable admission form from the tracker, fill it, attach your documents, and bring them to the school office to complete enrolment. There is also a fully offline path: download and print the blank admission form from the Admission page, fill it by hand, attach photocopies of the required documents and submit it in person at the school office.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-documents",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "Which documents are required for admission?",
    answer:
      "For every applicant: the student's B-Form (NADRA), a recent passport-size photograph, the previous class result card where applicable, and a copy of the father's or guardian's CNIC. Per GHS Babi Khel admission policy, a School Leaving Certificate (SLC) from the previous school is required for ALL admissions — both fresh admission and migration/transfer. For class 9 or 10 students migrating from another BISE-affiliated school or another board, the school additionally processes DMC, migration certificate and an enrollment/reference letter from the previous school's head through the BISE Peshawar portal as part of the board-level migration.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-track",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "How can I track my admission application status?",
    answer:
      "After submitting the online form, keep the reference number you received. On the Admission page, open the application status tracker and search by your reference number, your B-Form number, or your contact number — any one of them works. The tracker shows your current status (pending, under review, documents verified, interview scheduled, waitlisted, approved or admitted), any note from the school, and — once approved — links to download the printable admission form and related documents. You can also log in to the website's portal with your registered contact number to see your application timeline.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-migration",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "How does migration or transfer to GHS Babi Khel work for class 9 and 10?",
    answer:
      "School-level approval of your online application and board-level migration are two separate steps. After you are approved at the school, migration between BISE Peshawar-affiliated institutions (or from another board) is carried out on the BISE Peshawar portal by the sending and receiving schools, within the board's notified migration window for the academic year — a parent or student does not complete it by submitting a form to the board directly. A valid School Leaving Certificate from the previous school is required. For students coming from another board, the receiving school submits the student's DMC, migration certificate and an enrollment/reference letter from the previous school's head to BISE Peshawar along with the prescribed fee, which is paid through the board's own channels. For classes 6 to 8, a transfer between schools is handled at the school level and does not go through the BISE Peshawar portal.",
  },
  {
    id: "adm-fee",
    category: "Admissions",
    question: "Is there any admission fee or tuition fee?",
    answer:
      "No. Government High School Babi Khel is a government school, so admission and tuition are free of charge, as provided by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Students also receive free textbooks under the provincial free textbook scheme. Any fee that may apply in special cases (for example a BISE Peshawar board migration fee for class 9/10 transfers) is a board charge paid through the board's designated channels, not a school charge.",

  // ── Results & Exams ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    id: "res-check",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "How do I check my exam result on the website?",
    answer:
      "Open the Results page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/results), select your exam (class and examination name), and enter your roll number exactly as printed on your admit card. The result shows total marks, obtained marks, percentage, grade, pass/fail status and, on the Result Card page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/result-card), a full printable card with subject-wise marks and class position. Results only appear after the school administration publishes the exam, so if your roll number is not found the exam may not be published yet.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-exams",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "Which exams and results are available for each class?",
    answer:
      "For classes 6 to 8 the school conducts 1st semester and 2nd semester examinations. For classes 9 and 10 the school conducts Annual-I and Annual-II examinations, and those students additionally sit the BISE Peshawar SSC board examinations (SSC-I for class 9 and SSC-II for class 10). School internal results are published on the website's Results page once released by the school administration.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-bisep",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "How do I check my BISE Peshawar board result?",
    answer:
      "The Results page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/results) can search BISE Peshawar board results for SSC 9th and 10th class directly — enter your roll number in the board results section and the website fetches the result live from the official board portal (cloud.bisep.edu.pk). The website only reads from the board's official portal; it does not store board results. For anything beyond the displayed result (rechecking, certificates), contact BISE Peshawar or the school office.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-grades",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "What is the grading scale used for results?",
    answer:
      "The school uses the standard percentage-based scale: A+ for 90% and above, A for 80–89%, B for 60–79%, C for 45–59%, D for 33–44%, and Fail below 33%. A result card additionally shows the student's position in class and a subject-wise breakdown of marks for every subject of the exam.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-datesheet",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "Where can I find exam dates, date sheets and the exam schedule?",
    answer:
      "Exam schedules and date sheets are published as official notices on the Notices page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/notices) and as events on the academic Calendar page (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/calendar). You can subscribe to the calendar on your phone using the ICS feed (ghsbabikhel.indevs.in/calendar.ics) so exam dates and holidays appear directly in your phone's calendar app. Urgent exam announcements are also highlighted on the homepage news ticker.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-rollnumber",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "Where can I find my roll number for the exam?",
    answer:
      "Roll number slips for school exams are published on the Exam Roll Numbers page once the school administration finalises the seating plan, and are also announced as a notice on the Notices page. Search by your name or class to find your roll number. For the BISE Peshawar board exams (class 9 and 10), your official roll number is issued on your board admit card, which the school distributes closer to the exam.",
  },
  {
    id: "res-recheck",
    category: "Results & Exams",
    question: "What if I think there is a mistake in my result?",
    answer:
      "For a school-conducted exam (semester or Annual-I/II), contact the school office or your subject teacher directly so the marks can be verified against the answer sheet. For a BISE Peshawar board result (SSC-I or SSC-II), rechecking and reappraisal requests must be submitted to BISE Peshawar itself within the board's notified rechecking window — the school website only displays the board's published result and cannot change it.",
