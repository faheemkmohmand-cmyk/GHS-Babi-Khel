// ─── ANTI-CHEAT SEATING ALGORITHM (rev. 3 — class-sequence fix) ────────────
// Goal: place students into rooms such that:
//   1. Students are seated in the same round-robin CLASS SEQUENCE that was
//      used when exam roll numbers were generated (e.g. class 10 → class 9
//      → class 8 → class 7 → class 6 → class 10 → ...). This sequence is
//      derived directly from the roll numbers themselves (whichever class's
//      student got the lowest roll number goes first, etc.), so it always
//      matches Exam Roll Numbers exactly.
//   2. No two students of the same class are orthogonally adjacent
//      (front/back/left/right). Diagonal adjacency is OK.
//      → After placing in sequence order, if a same-class adjacency WOULD
//        occur, the algorithm swaps forward to the next eligible student of
//        a different class. This is the anti-cheat layer.
//   3. "Update Seating" shuffles WHICH student from each class sits in that
//      class's turn (like Update on Exam Roll Numbers), while "Auto-Generate"
//      (first time) keeps each class's students in their existing roll-no
//      order. Either way, the class SEQUENCE itself (10th, 9th, 8th, 7th,
//      6th, ...) never changes — only the individual student per class-turn
//      can change.
//
// Strategy:
//  1. Sort ALL students by exam_roll_no once, and record the order in which
//     each class first appears — that's the round-robin class sequence.
//  2. Group students by class. In Update mode, shuffle each class's group
//     randomly; in canonical mode, leave each class's group in roll-no order.
//  3. Re-interleave round-robin, following the class sequence from step 1 —
//     this is what keeps "10th, 9th, 8th, 7th, 6th, ..." intact either way.
//  4. Build a flat list of seatable desk positions across all rooms, in snake
//     (boustrophedon) row-major order.
//  5. Walk the desk list, placing one student at a time from the interleaved
//     list. After each placement, if the just-placed student would create a
//     same-class adjacency with an already-filled neighbour, swap forward to
//     the next eligible student of a different class.
//  6. If we run out of swap candidates (rare — e.g. one class hugely
//     outnumbers the others), place anyway and flag the seat as
//     "adjacency_conflict" so the admin UI can warn the user.
//
// The function returns assignments keyed by room, ready to bulk-insert.

/**
 * Live attendance for a specific exam date.
 *
 * FILTERING (rev. 7): the session_id filter has been REMOVED. It was causing
 * a bug where the Live Console showed all students as "Unmarked" even though
 * attendance had been taken — because the attendance rows' session_id didn't
 * match the seating plan's session_id (admin selected a different session in
 * the Exam Attendance dropdown).
 *
 * The tally in AdminExamConsole already matches by student_id — it only
 * counts students who are seated in the plan. So there's no risk of counting
 * students from other sessions. The only filtering we need is:
 *   1. exam_date matches today (server-side)
 *   2. subject matches (client-side, loose, with fallback)
 *
 * Subject matching is loose (bidirectional, case-insensitive substring). If
 * the subject filter returns 0 rows, we fall back to ALL rows for the date
 * (handles the case where paper_subject is blank or uses a completely
 * different naming convention).
 *
 * Subscribes to Supabase realtime on the full exam_attendance table and
 * refetches on any change — so the console updates live as invigilators
 * scan QR codes.
 *
 * ─── rev. 8 — STALE-DATA FIX (Problem 3) ────────────────────────────────────
 * Three changes to fix "Console Live shows old attendance after extending
 * paper time + updating attendance":
 *
 *   1. STABLE queryKey (useMemo): previously queryKey was a new array on
 *      every render, which caused the realtime useEffect to tear down and
 *      rebuild its Supabase channel on EVERY render. Events fired during
 *      the brief teardown window were LOST, so the console never refetched
 *      and stayed on stale data. Memoizing the key keeps the channel
 *      stable across renders (it only re-subscribes when examDate/
 *      sessionId/paperSubject actually change).
 *
 *   2. POLLING FALLBACK (refetchInterval: 5000): even if realtime drops
 *      an event (network hiccup, channel race, etc.), the query
 *      auto-refetches every 5 seconds. This guarantees the console can
 *      never be stuck on stale data for more than 5s.
 *
 *   3. ROW DEDUPLICATION: pre-migration duplicate rows (same student +
 *      subject + date but different exam_date string formats like
 *      "2026-07-06" vs "2026-07-06T00:00:00.000Z") were making the tally
 *      pick the wrong row — the admin would update one duplicate to
 *      "absent", but the OTHER duplicate (still "present") would win the
 *      "latest timestamp" comparison and the console kept showing
 *      "present". Deduping at the query layer collapses these so the
 *      tally always sees exactly ONE row per (student, subject, date).
