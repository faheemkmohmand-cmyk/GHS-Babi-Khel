// routePrefetch.ts — makes navbar navigation feel instant, even on slow
// internet, via two complementary layers:
//
// 1. INTENT PREFETCH (the big win):
//    The moment a finger TOUCHES or a cursor HOVERS any navbar link, the
//    target route's JS chunk starts downloading — a full tap takes 100-300ms
//    and a chunk is usually only 20-80KB, so by the time React Router
//    actually navigates, the chunk is already in the browser's module cache
//    and the page renders immediately. One delegated listener on the navbar
//    root covers every link inside it (mega-menu, mobile drawer, Roll No.
//    Slip countdown chips, admission CTA — even links added later).
//
// 2. BACKGROUND PREFETCH (idle warm-up): 
//    After the homepage fully loads (window load + browser idle), the main
//    public routes are warmed ONE AT A TIME, in priority order (the pages
//    visitors tap most: Merit List and Roll No. Slip first).
//    Sequential downloading never competes with the homepage's own data —
//    that's what made the old all-at-once prefetch sluggish on slow links.
//
// Both layers respect Data Saver and 2G: on metered connections we don't
// prefetch anything in the background (intent prefetch still runs — the
// user explicitly aims at that page, so it's never wasted data).

 * mobile browser happily reports "4g" while the connection is congested and
 * moving at a few dozen KB/s — the Network Information API's effectiveType is
 * a coarse bucket, not a measurement. On such a link this queue happily
 * started downloading 16+ route chunks in the background, one every 400 ms,
 * while the user was trying to open ONE page. The result is that the page
 * they actually wanted crawls, the full-screen loading fallback sits there
 * for many seconds, and the whole thing reads as "the site reloaded itself".
 *
 * So the gate now also defers on:
 *   • save-data (already honoured) and any metered connection,
 *   • a measured round-trip time high enough to mean "don't waste my bytes",
 *   • a downlink the browser itself rates as slow,
